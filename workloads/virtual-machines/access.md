# Access

Once a virtual machine is started you are able to connect to the consoles it exposes. Usually there are two types of consoles:

* Serial Console
* Graphical Console \(VNC\)

> Note: You need to have `virtctl` [installed](../../installation/) to gain access to the VirtualMachine.

## Accessing the serial console

The serial console of a virtual machine can be accessed by using the `console` command:

```bash
$ virtctl console --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG testvm
```

## Accessing the graphical console \(VNC\)

Accessing the graphical console of a virtual machine is usually done through VNC, which requires `remote-viewer`. Once the tool is installed you can access the graphical console using:

```bash
$ virtctl vnc --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG testvm
```
