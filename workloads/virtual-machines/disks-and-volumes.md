# Disks and Volumes

Making persistent storage in the cluster \(**volumes**\) accessible to vms consists of three parts. First, referencing volumes in `spec.volumes`. Second configuring **disks** in `spec.domain.discs` to add a disk to the vm. Third, adding a refererence to the defined volume on to the disk.

## Disks

Like all other vm devices a `spec.domain.devices.disks` element has a mandatory `name`. Furhter it has a mandatory `volumeName` entry which references a volume inside `spec.volumes`.

A disk can be made accessible via four different types:

* **disk**
* **cdrom**
* **floppy**
* **lun**

All possible configuration options are available in the [Disk API Reference](https://kubevirt.github.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_disk).

All types but **floppy** allow you to specify the `bus` attribute. The `bus` attribute determines how the disk will be presented to the Guest Operating System. **floppy** disks don't support the `bus` attribute: they are always attached to the `fdc` bus.

### lun

A `lun` disk will expose the volume as a LUN device to the vm. This allows the vm to execute arbitrary iscsi command passthrough.

A minimal example which attaches a `PersistentVolumeClame` named `mypvc` as a `lun` device to the vm:

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-lun
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        # This makes it a lun device
        lun: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
```

### disk

A `disk` disk will expose the volume as an ordinary disk to the vm.

A minimal example which attaches a `PersistentVolumeClame` named `mypvc` as a `disk` device to the vm:

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-disk
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        # This makes it a disk
        disk: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
```

You can set the disk `bus` type, overriding the defaults, which in turn depend on the chipset the VM is configured to use:

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-disk
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        # This makes it a disk
        disk:
          # This makes it exposed as /dev/vda, being the only and thus first
          # disk attached to the VM
          bus: virtio
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
```

### floppy

A `floppy` disk will expose the volume as a floppy drive to the vm.

A minimal example which attaches a `PersistentVolumeClame` named `mypvc` as a `floppy` device to the vm:

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-floppy
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        # This makes it a floppy
        floppy: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
```

### cdrom

A `cdrom` disk will expose the volume as a cdrom drive to the vm. It is read-only by default.

A minimal example which attaches a `PersistentVolumeClame` named `mypvc` as a `floppy` device to the vm:

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-cdrom
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        # This makes it a cdrom
        cdrom:
          # This makes the cdrom writeable
          readOnly: false
          # This makes the cdrom be exposed as SATA device
          bus: sata
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
```

## Volumes

Supported volume sources are

* **cloudInitNoCloud**
* **persistentVolumeClaim**
* **registryDisk**

All possible configuration options are available in the [Volume API Reference](https://kubevirt.github.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_volume).

### cloudInitNoCloud

Allows attaching `cloudInitNoCloud` data-sources to the vm. If the vm contains a proper cloud-init setup, it will pick up the disk as a user-data source.

A simple example which attaches a `Secret` as a cloud-init `disk` datasource may look like this:

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-cloudinitnocloud
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mybootdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
      - name: mynoclouddisk
        volumeName: mynocloudvolume
        disk: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
    - name: mynoclouddisk
      cloudInitNoCloud:
        secretRef:
          name: testsecret
```

### PersistentVolumeClaim

Allows connecting a `PersistentVolumeClaim` to a vm disk.

These types of disks make sense to use when the VirtualMachine's disk needs to persist after a VirtualMachine terminates. This allows for the VirtualMachine's data to remain persistent between restarts.

For KubeVirt to be able to consume the disk present on a PersistentVolume's filesystem, the disk must be named **disk.img** and be placed in the root path of the filesystem. Currently the disk is also required to be in raw format.

A simple example which attaches a `PersistentVolumeClaim` as a `disk` may look like this:

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-pvc
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
```

### Ephemeral Volume

An ephemeral volume is a local COW \(copy on write\) image that uses a network volume as a read-only backing store. With an ephemeral volume, the network backing store is never mutated. Instead all writes are stored on the ephemeral image which exists on local storage. KubeVirt dynamically generates the ephemeral images associated with a VM when the VM starts, and discards the ephemeral images when the VM stops.

Ephemeral volumes are useful in any scenario where disk persistence is not desired. The COW image is discarded when VM reaches a final state \(succeeded, failed\).

Currently, only `PersistentVolumeClaim` may be used as a backing store of the ephemeral volume.

Up to date information on the supported backing stores can be found in the KubeVirt [API](http://www.kubevirt.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_ephemeralvolumesource).

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-ephemeral-pvc
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        volumeName: mypvc
        lun: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvc
      ephemeral:
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mypvc
```

### registryDisk

The Registry Disk feature provides the ability to store and distribute Virtual Machine disks in the container image registry. Registry Disks can be assigned to Virtual Machines in the disks section of the Virtual Machine spec.

No network shared storage devices are utilized by Registry Disks. The disks are pulled from the container registry and reside on the local node hosting the Virtual Machines that consume the disks.

#### When to use a registryDisk

Registry Disks are ephemeral storage devices that can be assigned to any number of active Virtual Machines. This makes them an ideal tool for users who want to replicate a large number of Virtual Machine workloads that do not require persistent data. Registry Disks are commonly used in conjunction with Virtual Machine Replica Sets.

#### When Not to use a registryDisk

Registry Disks are not a good solution for any workload that requires persistent disks across Virtual Machine restarts, or workloads that require Virtual Machine live migration support. It is possible Registry Disks may gain live migration support in the future, but at the moment live migrations are incompatible with Registry Disks.

#### registryDisk Workflow Example

Users push Virtual Machine disks into the container registry using a KubeVirt base designed to work with the Registry Disk feature. The latest base container image is **kubevirt.io/registry-disk-v1alpha**.

Using this base image, users can inject a Virtual Machine disk into a container image in a way that is consumable by the KubeVirt runtime. Disks placed into the base container must be placed into the /disk directory. Raw and qcow2 formats are supported. Qcow2 is recommended in order to reduce the container image's size.

Example: Inject a Virtual Machine disk into a container image.

```text
cat << END > Dockerfile
FROM kubevirt.io/registry-disk-v1alpha
ADD fedora25.qcow2 /disk
END

docker build -t vmdisks/fedora25:latest .
```

Example: Upload the RegistryDisk container image to a registry.

```text
docker push vmdisks/fedora25:latest
```

Example: Attach the RegistryDisk as an ephemeral disk to a virtual machine.

```text
metadata:
  name: testvm-registrydisk
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: registrydisk
        volumeName: registryvolume
        disk: {}
  volumes:
    - name: registryvolume
      registryDisk:
        image: vmdisks/fedora25:latest
```

Note that a `registryDisk` is file-based and can therefore not be attached as a `lun` device to the vm.
